You have to Save The World!
Again!!!

You can drive UFO (Unbelievably Fun Object) with arrow keys: ← → ↑ ↓
When you flying up ↑ , UFO consumes fuel resource.
If you do not have any fuel left, you can not fly up.

The bottom pannel shows your resources: money, missiles, bullets, fuel.
Your main weapon loaded with bullets. You can shoot using `[SPACEBAR]`
If you are out of bullets, main weapon will be switched to missiles.
Your additional weapon is missiles. You can shoot using key `[M]` or `[7]`
Note: if you are out of missiles, they will be purchased.

Flower can generate useful pick-ups:armor, fuel, bullets, missiles... 
Currently generating item showed at the bottom of the Flower.
You can change generating item by pressing `[R]`.

Some sneaky alien race "Farting Aliens" got aware about this Flower and decided to steal it.
Your goal is to protect The Last Flower on the Planet and kill all h̶u̶m̶a̶n̶s̶ aliens.
Be careful: enemies also can shoot you.

You can build different towers to get some help with defence.
Normal Tower `[1]`, Freezing Tower `[2]`, Rocket Launcher `[3]` Laser `[4]`

You can build asteroids `[5]`, they are cheep and can be destroyed.
You can request orbital mine `[6]`, be careful, it also can explode near you!

It rains quite often here, and in the rain nobody can fly really fast.
You can move rain by dragging cloud and dropping it to the new place.
